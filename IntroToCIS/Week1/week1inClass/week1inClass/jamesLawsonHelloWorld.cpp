I looked on the forums very breifly(not saying it's a sure thing) and found many people saying that you cannot code in C++ in the particular 'Visual Studios Community For Mac' as you can in Windows. Xcode has a built-in editor and compiler, I think we can appropriately submit the assignments all the same. Please let me know if you would prefer code blocks for the screenshots and .cpp files." << endl;

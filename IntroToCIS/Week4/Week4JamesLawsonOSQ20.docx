\cf2 \strokec2 2)What is a Hierarchical Directory Structure? Which is the name and year of the Operating System first to use a \'91Hierarchical\'92\cf0 \strokec0  \cf2 \strokec2 Directory Structure?\
\
\cb4 Answer: A Hierarchical directory system is a file system on a computer that holds files and other directories beneath them, organizing them in a cascading order that is easy to work with.\
\cb3 \
\cb4 The first was Multics introduced in 1965\

\cf2 \strokec2 7)Do you have 32 or 64 bit CPU ? What is the exact brand/model of your CPU ?\
\
\cb4 Answer: Intel i5 - 64 bit\
\cf0 \cb3 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 8)Do you use a 32 or 64 bit OS ? How did you discover this ?\
\
\cb4 Answer: My 2012 MacBook runs on High Sierra which has transitioned to 64 bit, but has (temporary) compatibility with 32 bit apps, notifying users that it will need to be updated at some point in the near future. Source: Quora\
\cf0 \cb3 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 9)What does it mean to be a 64 bit Operating System?\
\
\cb4 The amount of bits refers to how the os handles information from the CPU, the 64 bit handling larger amounts of RAM and more effectively than the 32 bit.\
\cf0 \cb3 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 10)How many Operating Systems are listed in the website:\cf0 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_operating_systems\
\
Answer:\cb4  58\
\cf0 \cb3 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 11)Are there OS\'92s that run on hardware larger than 64 bits ?\
\
Answer: \cb4 No, there are128, 256 and even 512-bit processors but having an OS run at that capacity would be overkill. Source: Quora.com\cb3 \
\cf0 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 12)Why does understanding how an OS works help you as a programmer ?\
\
\cf0 \strokec0 Answer: \cb4 I think that understanding the order of which steps the computer takes in starting up and executing is key to a programmers efficiency, especially application developers. Understanding the CLI (terminal in Mac) has been a huge help in version control for me. I try to upload any immense projects on to git hub and I use terminal commands to navigate through my computer\'92s directory and submit repositories.\
\cb3 \
\cf2 \strokec2 13)What was the first computer OS ever used ?\
\
\cf0 \strokec0 Answer: \cb4 MDOS/MIDAS introduced by microsoft\
\cb3 \
\cf2 \strokec2 14)What are 6 essential managers found in all operating systems \'96 define each.\
\
Answer:\

\b \cb4 \ul Memory Manager
\b0 \ulnone : management of primary memory or main memory to provide fast storage that can be manipulated by the CPU. \

\b \ul Process Manager
\b0 \ulnone : Keeps track of the CPU and state of the current process.\

\b \ul Device Manager
\b0 \ulnone : Monitors and supervises devices, also known as input/output controller\

\b \ul File Manager
\b0 \ulnone : Maintains information, save location, usage, and status, often referred to as directory or file system.\

\b \ul Security
\b0 \ulnone : Password protection for authorization to make changes to the system, overwrite protection/verification etc.\

\b \ul Debugger(?)
\b0 \ulnone : I am not 100% if there would be a dedicated manager for errors/bugs but perhaps another factor of the OS to prevent duplicate files, automatic app updates to ensure compatibility etc.\

\cf2 \strokec2 15)How do you open the BIOS Manager in a Window computer?\
\
Answer: \
\cb4 1. Turn off PC, wait 5\'92\
2. Turn PC on and then immediately press escape to open startup menu\
3. Press f10 to open BIOS setup utility\cb3 \
\cf0 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 16)How do you open the BIOS in a MAC computer?\
\
Answer:\
\cb4 1.Press power button on the Mac system\
2.Press and hold command, option, o and f (OF - Open Firmware)\
3.Enter commands following \'910>\'92\
\cf0 \cb3 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 17)How does the OS save the programmer/app developer time?\
\
Answer: \
\cb4 Each of the various managers can provide a useful crutch for desired action, the process manager can give an application programmer the option to troubleshoot and experiment with different CPU priorities. The File Manager can help a developer team keep track of repositories/stages of their projects and provide means for rolling back if debugging calls for it. \

\cf2 \strokec2 18)Explain this diagram. Why is it important to understand it as a programmer?\
\
Answer:\
\cb4 The diagram depicts a cascading order of how the user interacts with an application, how the operating system interacts with the application in use, and how the hardware is used in accordance with the operating system installed. Understanding the hierarchy of hardware to software is crucial to any programmer with regards to choosing the correct IDE and compiler, properly using the directory to organize project folders, updating software, utilizing or upgrading the RAM on a system and creating responsive applications/programs that can function on various devices.\
\cb3 \
\cf0 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 19) Explain why checking the RAM at startup is necessary before\cf0 \strokec0  \cf2 \strokec2 loading the OS into it.\
\
Answer:\
\cb4 The PC/Mac cannot run or execute instructions directly from the machine\'92s hard drive or disk. In order to operate, the program or application needs to be allocated from the hard drive/disk/cd into the temporary storage. The CPU can only read instructions from temporary memory\
\cf0 \cb3 \strokec0 \
\cf2 \strokec2 20) Is it possible to update the Device Drivers on your PC, if so HOW ? Do it and explain\cf0 \strokec0  \cf2 \strokec2 the results.\
\
Answer: \
\cb4 On Mac, you can always check for updates by navigating to the main apple user menu at the top left of the screen and clicking \'91software update\'92. If there is a new Mac OS X update available, installing will upgrade video divers, graphic drivers etc from what is currently in use. I have automatic updates turned off and I\'92m currently running 10.13.4, 10.14.0(Mojave) is the most current OS.\
\
Some of the highlighted perks of upgrading to the new OS include a \'91Dark Mode\'92 as a new, interesting skins that other IOS apps will utilize Apples API to mimic. A new, dynamic desktop with clean and user friendly navigation, stacking icons on the desktop instead of filling the display with clutter, a new screenshot tool and many others. \
